# ElectionLogic

## Project Overview
This project is an **AI model** designed to predict Croatia's 2024 parliamentary election outcomes, achieving an impressive **92% accuracy**.

### Background
The model was developed by a team of four high school students as part of **N1** and **BIRD Incubator's** *"AI Elections"* competition. Although we did not officially advance to the final round, our prediction accuracy ranked us **3rd out of 12 teams**.

### Technical Approach
Our model integrates:
- **VARMAX (Vector Autoregressive Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors)** modeling for multivariate time-series analysis.
- **Linear Autoregression** techniques.
- **Polling data** to enhance prediction precision.
